NS3 5G Simulation Database & LSTM Prediction

This repository contains a simulation-based SQL database generated using NS3 (C++) and a predictive model built with LSTM to forecast Resource Block (RB) Allocation in a 5G wireless environment.
üì• Download the Database

You can download the SQL database from the following link:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q_nTojYQzSMmUZViPwUioq39teKB__8R/view?usp=sharing

üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

    Upload the SQL file to your Google Drive.

    Open LoadAndClean.ipynb in Google Colab.

    Mount your Drive and load the database.

    Use the notebook to clean and verify the data (e.g., check for corrupted entries).

üóÉÔ∏è Database Structure

The database files are named using the format:
XuesYgnbsDateTime
Where:

    X = Number of UEs

    Y = Number of gNBs

    DateTime = Timestamp of creation

üìå Simulation Parameters

    Bandwidth per gNB: 5 MHz ‚Üí 26 RBs

    Modulation: OFDMA

    Operation Mode: TDD

    gNB Power: 10 dBm

    Services Used:

        UE_0 ‚Üí NGMN_VOIP

        UE_1 ‚Üí Constant Packet Sizes

        Others may include: NGMN_VIDEO, NGMN_FTP, NGMN_GAMING

    Each gNB: Randomly connected to 2‚Äì5 UEs
